    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As I mentioned earlier my name is Alec, but my full name is Alec Galloway.
      I am originally from Chicago, IL, but I recently moved to Kirkland, WA to pursue greater opportunities.  Now I love, Chicago,
      and very well may go back eventually, but right now I needed to hop off the porch and remove myself from a comfortable environment to focus up.
      Currently I work for a company called Luxoft doing manual device testing for a AT&T, a client of ours.  This device testing consists of mobile devices
      such as tablets and phones, both old and new.  Essentially our team tests around software and hardware to find any defects and ensure consistent behavior
      before software is pushed out to consumers across the nation.
