## Description

_Here are the requirements for my project_

* A list of projects I have created with active links to them (either on GitHub or GitHub pages)
* For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses
* An “About Me” section
    * Include your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to        take a class on programming, etc)
    * Your current interests/hobbies/skills
* Create a gh-pages branch so that you site can be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio (for example).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download the site from this repo:_
* _Extract it to a directory you will remember (Ex. Desktop, Documents, Downloads)_
* _Once extracted, doubleclick the **index.html** file._
* _easy-to-understand_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
